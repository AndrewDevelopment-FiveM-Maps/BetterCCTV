# Andrew's Development BetterCCTV
If you are tired of having to RP out that there are no cameras or you have to rp that their are cameras when there arnt, then thats the case, this is what this map is made for. This just adds cameras around the map, making it so if there are cameras, then it makes it easy for you to rp.

For more scripts and maps like these, check out our development discord.
